### Other AI / Data Science Projects

- [Chatbot for Kids](https://github.com/chihangs/chatbot_kid)
  Utilised ChatGPT API to create simple chatbot aimed at chatting with kids who only know simple English, with features to tell kids about their typos and provide Chinese translation. A 5-year-old kid successfully chatted with the chatbot for a while.
- [Diabetes Classification](https://github.com/chihangs/diabetes_classification)
  Used random forest, gradient boosting, neural network with SMOTE-ENN and random over-sampling to classify diabetes or not.
- [Object Detection by Instance Segmentation](https://github.com/chihangs/INM705)
  Mask R-CNN model was used for Microsoft COCO dataset. Achieved higher average precision than original paper by specialising on object detection of aircrafts and birds only. (NB: could also be due to easier classes than average but not ascertained and out of scope.)
- [Reinforcement Learning Tic-tac-toe, Connect4](https://github.com/chihangs/INM707)
  Leveraged Python to develop game environment for Tic-tac-toe and Connect4 using tabular Q-learning and deep Q Network (DQN) methods for reinforcement learning.
- [NLP Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Review](https://github.com/chihangs/IMDB)
  Trained on IMDB movie reviews and generalised the models to test sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews; NLP, LSTM, GRU, and LSTM with attention, transformer models were used and compared.
- [CIFAR-10 Image Classification](https://github.com/alexxcollins/AI_INM702_collab)
  Developed and implemented convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from CIFAR-10 dataset.
- [Neural Network - Build from Scratch](https://github.com/alexxcollins/AI_INM702_collab)
  Devised a neural network model class object from scratch using Python and Numpy; tested on MNIST dataset.
- [Predictive Model of Property Price](https://github.com/chihangs/INM701)
  Predicted home price in King County of the US with thorough data exploration via linear regression, KNN, and neural network for comparison.
- [Find the Fastest or Cheapest Route](https://github.com/chihangs/suen_INM702-Individual-task1)
  Find the fastest/cheapest route by Dijkstra algorithm, brute force and self-made method for comparison.
