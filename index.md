### Other AI / Data Science Projects

- [Chatbot for Kids](https://github.com/chihangs/chatbot_kid)
  Utilised ChatGPT API to create simple chatbot aimed at chatting with kids who only know simple English, with features to tell kids about their typos and provide Chinese translation. A 5-year-old kid successfully chatted with the chatbot for a while.
- [Diabetes Classification](https://github.com/chihangs/diabetes_classification)
  Used random forest, gradient boosting, neural network with SMOTE-ENN and random over-sampling to classify diabetes or not.
